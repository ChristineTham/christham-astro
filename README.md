![deploy](https://github.com/ChristineTham/christinetham.github.io/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)

This is a version of my personal blog/web site written in Markdown and [Astro](https://astro.build) using the [Hello Astro](https://github.com/hellotham/hello-astro) starter as a template.

It is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) and deployed via Github Action workflow.
