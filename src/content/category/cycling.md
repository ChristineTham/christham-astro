description: I like to cycle for fun and exercise.

I cycled when I was in primary school, but crashed my Raleigh three-speed into a fence, and then never cycled again until my 40s, when I bought a hybrid bicycle for exercise. I soon graduated to road bikes, and currently own a number of road bikes.
