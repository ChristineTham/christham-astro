Having lunch at the Grace of India Restaurant with Lyn Cheah and Margaret Stow. The food here is excellent - the lamb shank with 24 spices is to die for, and the dhal maharani and palak paneer are excellent vegetarian dishes. We were so greedy we almost contemplated ordering another bowl of rice just to soak up the sauce.
