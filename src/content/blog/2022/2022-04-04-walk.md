A blatantly self promoting and boasting post: Finally managed to fit into a size 10 (M) skirt. Okay, it's tight, and I can't actually sit down comfortably or breathe properly, but at least I can wear it.

Decided to wear this outfit to walk from Roseville to Artarmon to collect my
car from servicing. It's a lovely day.
