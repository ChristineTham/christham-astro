Lunch at Sunflower Taiwanese with Karen Lim and Mariel Jw FbTime. We shared the century egg tofu as a starter. I am used to drinking cold soy milk, this is the first time I had hot, and I like it. I ordered the Classic Taiwanese Benton bowl, and there was so much I could only manage half the pork chop. The steam halibut that Karen had was delicious (I had a small slice) and the Jah Jiang noodle also looked great.
