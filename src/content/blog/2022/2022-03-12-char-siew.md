I like to buy char siew from a Chinese BBQ shop, but I always ask them not
to slice it, because I take it home, heat it up using the fan forced griller
in my oven, and then slice it myself.

I stir fried some chinese cabbage, and served it with a boiled salted duck egg,
which is typical in some Hong Kong cafes.
