Nerd achievement for 2023 - finally managed to get Rogomatic working. I used to play the Unix computer game rogue when I was in uni in the 1980s, but was never good at it - I always get killed before Level 20. I am now too old to ever master it, so Rogomatic plays my games for me.

## Instructions

Reference: [Rogue and Rog-O-Matic](https://www.anthive.com/project/rogue/)

### Create a Docker container

Run a Debian based Docker container.

```sh
docker pull debian:buster
docker run -it --name rogue debian:buster
```

### Prepare for building

Do this inside a terminal session in the Docker container.

```sh
apt update
apt install build-essential wget curl sudo gcc-multilib lib32ncurses5-dev vim
adduser christie
adduser christie sudo
adduser christie games
su - christie
```

### Build and install rogue

```sh
wget https://www.anthive.com/rog/rogue5.4.4-ant-r1.1.4-src.tar.gz
tar xvzf rogue5.4.4-ant-r1.1.4-src.tar.gz
cd rogue5.4.4-ant-r1.1.4
./configure CFLAGS=-m32
make
sudo make install
```
