I finished building "Cadel" - a road bike with an Olmo Kurva frame and Ultegra
groupset plus 3T components, in 2011, on the day Cadel Evans won the Tour
de France. It was my first bicycle built from parts up.

I was going to sell it on Ebay, but decided to resurrect it by changing the
wheels and tyres. I am planning to use it as an indoor training bike connected
to Wahoo KICKR Snap.
